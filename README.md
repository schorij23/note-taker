## User Story
AS A small business owner<br>
I WANT to be able to write and save notes<br>
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete<br>

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a note-taking application<br>
WHEN I open the Note Taker<br>
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page<br>
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page<br>
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column<br>
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text<br>
THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page<br>
WHEN I click on the Save button<br>
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear<br>
